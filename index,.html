          <p>
            Grubhub helps you find and order food from wherever you are. How it
            works: you type in an address, we tell you the restaurants that
            deliver to that locale as well as showing you droves of pickup
            restaurants near you. Want to be more specific? Search by cuisine,
            restaurant name or menu item. We'll filter your results accordingly.
            When you find what you're looking for, you can place your order
            online or by phone, free of charge. Oh, and we also give you access
            to reviews, coupons, special deals and a 24/7 customer care team
            that tracks each order and makes sure you get exactly what you want.
